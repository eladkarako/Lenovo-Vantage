SQLite Copyright Information

All of the code and documentation in SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.

The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in SQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship with a larger application. Some scripts used as part of the build process (for example the "configure" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other open-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final deliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those scripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the SQLite library.

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.

Warranty of Title.
Hwaci hereby represents and warrants to Licensee that Hwaci is the owner of the SQLite software or otherwise has the right to grant to Licensee the rights set forth in this Agreement. In the event any breach or threatened breach of the foregoing representation and warranty, Licensee's sole remedy shall be to require Hwaci or to either:

procure, at Hwaci's expense, the right to use the SQLite software,
replace the SQLite software or any part thereof that is in breach and replace it with Software of comparable functionality that does not cause any breach, or
refund to Licensee the full amount of the license fee upon the return of the Software and all copies thereof to Hwaci.
Optional Warranty of Functionality.
Licensee may elect to receive maintenance support for an additional fee over and above the fee for this license. The charge for such optional maintenance support shall be Hwaci's regular list price for maintenance and support for the SQLite software as published from time to time by Hwaci. Licensee shall notify Hwaci in writing if it desires to receive optional extended maintenance. Hwaci may elect to discontinue maintenance at any time upon notice to Licensee, and refund of any then unearned maintenance fees.

Hwaci's warranties set forth in this agreement are exclusive and are in lieu of all other warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.

Limitation of Liability.
Hwaci shall not be responsible for, and shall not pay, any amount of incidental, consequential or other indirect damages, whether based on lost revenue or otherwise, regardless of whether Hwaci was advised of the possibility of such losses in advance. In no event shall Hwaci's liability hereunder exceed the amount of license fees paid by Licensee, regardless of whether Licensee's claim is based on contract, tort, strict liability, product liability or otherwise.

Notice.
Any notice required by this Agreement or given in connection with it, shall be in writing and shall be given to the appropriate party by personal delivery or by certified mail, postage prepaid, or recognized overnight delivery services.
